Within the analysis.py file you will be able to find the code used for the exploratory analysis. The results of this analysis is in the DS_Images folder. There are additional folders within DS_Images that correspond to the plots generated and the results of the three different correlation measures used. Various plots are grouped based on other variables, such as hour, month, site, or building type when applicable. The primary_use image is a bar chart of the building types of the data.
